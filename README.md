# About me 

I'm always trying to learn new technologies and acquiring new skills. I've been using GNU/Linux for about one year and i very much enjoy changing and personalizing it to my preferences and learning how it works. 

My first experience with GNU/Linux was using the Debian distribution, while i did enjoy using it, i wanted to try out a different distribution. That's when i've started using the Fedora distribution, which is the one i'm still currently using. 

I have recently been learning FOSS tools such as QEMU with KVM and Virt Manager (virtual machines), Syncthing, LibreOffice, Gimp, Krita and others.
