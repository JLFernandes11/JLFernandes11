# Hi there ðŸ‘‹



My name is John, and I'm a Chemistry graduate. Always learning new technologies and skills. 

Check out my [Partial Least Squares Regression](https://github.com/JLFernandes11/PLS-Regression-Chemistry) and [Principal Component Regression](https://github.com/JLFernandes11/PCR-Chemistry) for chemical spectroscopy multivariate calibration written in Python. 

I'm interested in all things related to: 

- ðŸ“š Python
- ðŸ’» GNU/Linux
- ðŸŒ± Chemistry
- ðŸ“„ Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)
- ðŸ“ˆ Data Analysis

# About me 

I'm always trying to learn new technologies and acquire new skills. I've been using GNU/Linux for about a year, and I very much enjoy customizing and personalizing it to my preferences, as well as learning how it works. 

My first experience with GNU/Linux was using the Debian distribution. Although I enjoyed using it, I wanted to try out a different distribution. That's when I started using the Fedora distribution, which is the one I'm still currently using. 

I have recently been learning FOSS tools such as QEMU with KVM and Virt Manager (virtual machines), Syncthing, LibreOffice, Gimp, Krita, and others.
